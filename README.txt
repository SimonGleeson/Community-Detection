This programs assumes you have a results folder in the same directory as main.py

Choose a network, a number of circles and an encoding as follows

python main.py network circles encoding

For example, for network 0, and K = 4 circles, and the standard encoding it would be

python main.py 0 4 phi1

There are three encoding options; phi1, w1, w2

Results are saved as csvs in the results folder. 

Pyqpbo may have to be installed directly from the pyqpbo github
